# Python Machine Learning Notebooks (Tutorial style)

You can start with this article that I wrote in Heartbeat magazine (on Medium platform): 
### ["Some Essential Hacks and Tricks for Machine Learning with Python"](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/some-essential-hacks-and-tricks-for-machine-learning-with-python-5478bc6593f2)

## Essential tutorial-type notebooks on Pandas and Numpy
Jupyter notebooks covering a wide range of functions and operations on the topics of NumPy, Pandans, Seaborn, matplotlib etc.
* **[Basics of Numpy array](https://github.com/tirthajyoti/PythonMachineLearning/blob/master/Pandas%20and%20Numpy/Basics%20of%20Numpy%20arrays.ipynb)**
* **[Basics of Pandas DataFrame](https://github.com/tirthajyoti/PythonMachineLearning/blob/master/Pandas%20and%20Numpy/Basics%20of%20Pandas%20DataFrame.ipynb)**
* **[Basics of Matplotlib and Descriptive Statistics](https://github.com/tirthajyoti/PythonMachineLearning/blob/master/Pandas%20and%20Numpy/Basics%20of%20Matplotlib%20and%20Descriptive%20Statistics.ipynb)**

## Tutorial-type notebooks covering classification

* _k_-nearest neighbor classification
* Decision trees and Random Forest Classification
* Support vector machine classification (**[check the article I wrote in Towards Data Science on SVM and sorting algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-the-good-old-sorting-algorithm-helps-a-great-machine-learning-technique-9e744020254b))**
